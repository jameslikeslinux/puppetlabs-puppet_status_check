## Description

Puppet Status Check provides a way to alert the end-user when Puppet is not in an ideal state. It uses pre-set indicators and has a simplified output that directs the end-user to the next steps for resolution.

## Setup

### What this module affects

This module primarily provides status indicators the fact named `puppet_status_check`. Once nodes have been classified with the module, facts will be generated and the optional indicators can occur. By default, fact collection is set to only check the status of the Puppet agent. Puppet infrastructure checks require additional configuration.

### Setup requirements

Install the module, plug-in sync will be used to deliver the required facts for this module, to each agent node in the environment the module is installed in.

## Usage

Classify nodes with `puppet_status_check`. Notify resources will be added to a node on each Puppet run if indicator's are reporting as `false`. These can be viewed in the Puppet report for each node, or queried from Puppetdb.

### Enable infrastructure checks

The default fact population will not perform checks related to puppet infrastructure services such as the puppetserver, puppetdb, or postgresql. To enable the checks for Puppet servers, set the following parameter to those infrastructure node(s):

```
puppet_status_check::role: primary
```

### Disable

To completely disable the collection of `puppet_status_check` facts, uninstall the module or [classify the module](#class-declaration) with the `enabled` parameter:

```
puppet_status_check::enabled: false
```

## Reporting Options

### Class declaration

To enable fact collection and configure notifications, classify nodes with the `puppet_status_check` class. Examples using `site.pp`:

Check basic agent status:

```puppet
node 'node.example.com' {
  include 'puppet_status_check'
}
```

Check puppet server infrastructure status:

```puppet
node 'node.example.com' {
  class { 'puppet_status_check':
    role => 'primary',
  }
}
```

For maximum coverage, report on all default indicators. However, if you need to make exceptions for your environment, classify the array parameter `indicator_exclusions` with a list of all the indicators you do not want to report on.

```puppet
class { 'puppet_status_check':
  indicator_exclusions => ['S0001','S0003','S0003','S0004'],
}
```

### Using a Puppetdb Query to report status.

As the module uses Puppet's existing fact behavior to gather the status data from each of the agents, it is possible to use PQL (puppet query language) to gather this information.

Consult with your local Puppet administrator to construct a query suited to your organizational needs. 
Please find some examples of using the [puppetdb_cli gem](#https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb-cli) to query the status check facts below:

1. To find the complete output from all nodes listed by certname (this could be a large query based on the number of agent nodes, further filtering is advised ):
   ```shell
   puppet query 'facts[certname,value] { name = "puppet_status_check" }'
   ```
        
2. To find the complete output from all nodes listed by certname with the `primary` role:
   ```shell
   puppet query 'facts[certname,value] { name = "puppet_status_check" and certname in facts[certname] { name = "puppet_status_check_role" and value = "primary" } }'
   ```

3. To find those nodes with a specific status check set to false:
   ```shell
   puppet query 'inventory[certname] { facts.puppet_status_check.S0001 = false }'
   ```

### Ad-hoc Report (Plans)

The plan `puppet_status_check::summary` summarizes the status of each of the checks on target nodes that have the `puppet_status_check` fact enabled. Sample output can be seen below:

**TBC**

#### Setup Requirements

`puppet_status_check::summary` utilize [hiera](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/hiera_intro.html) to lookup test definitions, this requires placing a static hierarchy in your **environment level** [hiera.yaml](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/hiera_config_yaml_5.html).

```yaml
plan_hierarchy:
  - name: "Static data"
    path: "static.yaml"
    data_hash: yaml_data
```

See the following [documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/hiera.html#outside-apply-blocks) for further explanation.

#### Using Static Hiera data to populate indicator_exclusions when executing plans

Place the plan_hierarchy listed in the step above, in the environment layer.

Create a [static.yaml] file in the environment layer hiera data directory
```yaml
puppet_status_check::indicator_exclusions:                                             
  - '<TEST ID>'                                                                
``` 

Indicator ID's within array will be excluded when `running puppet_status_check::summary`.

#### Running the plans

The `puppet_status_check::summary` plans can be run from the [Puppet Bolt](https://puppet.com/bolt). More information on the parameters in the plan can be seen in the [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

Example call from the command line to run `puppet_status_check::summary` against all infrastructure nodes:

```shell
bolt plan run puppet_status_check::summary role=primary
```
Example call from the command line to run `puppet_status_check::summary` against all regular agent nodes:

```shell
bolt plan run puppet_status_check:summary role=agent
```

Example call from the command line to run against a set of infrastructure nodes:

```shell
bolt plan run puppet_status_check::summary targets=server-70aefa-0.region-a.domain.com,psql-70aefa-0.region-a.domain.com
```

Example call from the command line to exclude indicators for `puppet_status_check::infra_summary`:

```shell
bolt plan run puppet_status_check::summary -p '{"indicator_exclusions": ["S0001","S0021"]}'
```
Example call from the command line to exclude indicators for `puppet_status_check::agent_summary`:

```shell
bolt plan run puppet_status_check::summary -p '{"indicator_exclusions": ["AS001","AS002"]}'
```

## Reference

### Fact: puppet_status_check_role

This fact is used to determine which status checks are included on an infrastructure node. Classify the `puppet_status_check` module with a `role` parameter to change the role.

| Role     | Description |
| -------- | - |
| primary  | The node hosts a puppetserver, puppetdb, database, and certificate authority |
| compiler | The node hosts a puppetserver and puppetdb |
| postgres | The node hosts a database |
| agent    | The node runs a puppet agent service |

_The role is `agent` by default. _

### Fact: puppet_status_check

This fact is confined to run on infrastructure nodes only.

Refer  below for next steps when any indicator reports a `false`.

| S0029        | Determines if number of current connections to Postgresql DB is approaching 90% of the `max_connections` defined.  | First determine the need to increase connections, evaluate if this message appears on every puppet run, or if idle connections from recent component restarts may be to blame. If persistent, impact is minimal unless you need to add more components such as Compilers or Replicas, if you plan to increase the number of components on your system, increase max_connections value. To increase the maximum number of connections in postgres, adjust `puppet_enterprise::profile::database::max_connections`. Consider also increasing `shared_buffers` if that is the case as each connection consumes RAM.                                                                                                                  |

| S0035        | Determines if ``puppet module list`` is returning any warnings | If S0035 returns ``false``, i.e., warnings are present, you should run `puppet module list --debug` and resolve the issues shown.  The Puppetfile does NOT include Forge module dependency resolution. You must make sure that you have every module needed for all of your specified modules to run.Please refer to [Managing environment content with a Puppetfile](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/puppetfile.html) for more info on Puppetfile and refer to the specific module page on the forge for further information on specific dependancies                                                                     |

| S0038        | Determines whether the number of environments within `$codedir/environments` is less than 100 | Having a large number of code environments can negatively affect Puppet Server performance. [See the Configuring Puppet Server documentation for more information.](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/server/tuning_guide) You should examine if you need them all, any unused environments should be removed. If all are required you can ignore this warning.                    |
| S0039        | Determines if Puppets Server has reached its `queue-limit-hit-rate`,and is sending messages to agents. | [Check the  max-queued-requests article for more information.](https://support.puppet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003769433)                      |
| S0045        | Determines if Puppet Servers are configured with an excessive number of JRubies. | Because each JRuby instance consumes additional memory, having too many can reduce the amount of heap space available to Puppet server and cause excessive garbage collections.  While it is possible to increase the heap along with the number of JRubies, we have observered diminishing returns with more than 12 JRubies and therefore recommend an upper limit of 12. We also recommend allocating between 1 - 2gb of heap memory for each JRuby. |
| AS001        | Determines if the agent host certificate is expiring in the next 90 days.                                     | Use a puppet query to find expiring host certificates. `puppet query 'inventory[certname] { facts.agent_status_check.AS001 = false }'` |

| AS003        | Determines the certname configuration parameter is incorrectly set outside of the [main] section of the puppet.conf file.                                 | The Puppet documentation states clearly certname should always be placed solely in the [main] section to prevent unforeseen issues with the operation of the puppet agent https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/configuration.html#certname |
| AS004        | Determines if the host copy of the CRL expires in the next 90 days.                                         | If the Output of S0023 on the primary server is also false use the resolution steps in S0023.
